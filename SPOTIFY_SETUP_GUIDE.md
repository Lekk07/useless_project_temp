# üéµ Spotify Integration Setup Guide

## ‚ùå Current Issues Identified

### 1. **Invalid Redirect URI**
Your HTML file has: `"https://eloquent-basbousa-19e833.netlify.appss"`
- Extra "s" at the end (should be `.app` not `.appss`)
- This must EXACTLY match what's configured in your Spotify app

### 2. **Client ID Configuration**
- Client ID `89c4fd37aff24494b0f20708273b4bde` appears to be configured
- But redirect URI mismatch will cause authentication to fail

### 3. **OAuth Flow Issues**
- Using Authorization Code flow without backend to exchange code for token
- Need to use Implicit Grant flow for client-side apps

## üîß How to Fix

### Step 1: Fix Spotify App Settings

1. Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/)
2. Open your app settings
3. Add these **exact** redirect URIs:
   ```
   https://eloquent-basbousa-19e833.netlify.app
   http://localhost:3000
   ```
   (Make sure there's NO extra "s" at the end)

### Step 2: Use the Corrected HTML Code

Replace your current HTML file with the fixed version below that:
- Uses correct redirect URI
- Implements proper Implicit Grant flow
- Has better error handling
- Uses token-based authentication instead of code

## üì± Android App Issues (Bumpy-useless project)

### Critical Problems Found:

1. **Missing Spotify SDK**: The required AAR file is not present
2. **Placeholder Client ID**: Still set to `"your_spotify_client_id_here"`
3. **Outdated SDK approach**: Using deprecated AAR method

### Android Setup Steps:

1. **Download Spotify SDK**:
   ```bash
   cd app/libs
   wget https://github.com/spotify/android-sdk/releases/download/v0.8.0/spotify-app-remote-release-0.8.0.aar
   ```

2. **Set Client ID** in `SpotifyManager.kt`:
   ```kotlin
   private const val CLIENT_ID = "89c4fd37aff24494b0f20708273b4bde"
   ```

3. **Verify Redirect URI** matches in both:
   - Android Manifest: `spotify-shaker-auth://callback`
   - Spotify App Settings: Add `spotify-shaker-auth://callback`

## üåê Web App Requirements

- Spotify Premium account (required for playback control)
- HTTPS hosting (Netlify is good)
